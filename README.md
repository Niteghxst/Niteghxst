# About Me
My name's Niteghxst, Nite for short, and I'm an avid gamer and game enthusiast and have been ever since I was 4. Yeah I know, early, it's about 20 years ago too, feel old yet? I also love to listen to music, even more so when I'm working, programming, or drawing/spriting something for a mod.

My current projects are 3 different [Starsector](https://fractalsoftworks.com) mods, all round. So the programming as well as the spriting are (for now) solely done by myself. I am open to collaboration and always looking for extra eyes or hands to help out the development. I also got a long-term WIP Minecraft QOL mod but that's on the low at the moment.

As for my knowledge, I've done a 4 year study of Application Developer followed by 1.25 years of Uni (Software Engineer), which I had to quit with due too personal reasons. I got knowledge in the whole website-development "kit" (HTML, CSS/SASS/SCSS, PHP, JS (Regular & NodeJS), as well as Java. Outside of development languages I'm certified in the Microsoft Office Suite for Excel, Word, Powerpoint and Access.
